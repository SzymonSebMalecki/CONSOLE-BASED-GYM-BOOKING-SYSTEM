# CST2555GYMBOOKINGSYSTEMCOURSEWORK
This is the repository for terminal based gym booking system which I developed as a part of the first coursework from CST2555 Web Applications and Databases Module which is part of my Computer Science Batchelor Degree Program in the Second Year at Middlesex University. This project is a work in progress and JavaFx GUI will be implemented so that users of this system will be able to manage everything more conveniently from JavaFx window rather than doing this manually from the console based system. Enjoy :) Please note that all the work is copyrighted and hereby its my own interactullar property and it's protected by MIT licence and replication of the code of is not allowed.
